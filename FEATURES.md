# Features
Currently there are types of features. Priority and quality of life. Priority is well, priority. And quality of life are features which are nice to have.

## Priority
- Closing the entire tab created for the debugging session when either the terminal.

## Quality of life
- Identify project root based on common files.
  - Detect the name of the binary

## Completed
- (fb9a91) Tab completion for file names when prompts are enabled. For both specifying source and binary files.

## Additional notes
This file contains features that I want to have implemented.
If you feel that a feature is unnecessary or irrelevant free
to discuss the relevancy of each feature listed here.
For now just create an issue with the tag "feature-relevancy".

The format of the issue is as follows.
1. The exact name of the feature. Copy and paste it.
2. Why you think it is not needed.
